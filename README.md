## About

While I'd like to claim credit for this project, it's a rather famous application of gradient noise and flowfields. Essentially, a vector field created with some type of gradient noise (simplex noise in this implementation) is used to move a point. This point's trail creates a line, which, together with many other points, yields these beautiful patterns.
